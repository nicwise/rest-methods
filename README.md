# server-methods
Promise-based, self-documenting isomorphic RESTful APIs.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/philcockfield/server-methods.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/philcockfield/server-methods)

Publish javascript functions as a REST/resource-oriented endpoint with a simple promise-based RPC style invocation on the client.



## TODO
- [ ] Generate HTML documentation page (/server-methods)
- [ ] Server => Server communications.
- [ ] Pass query string into method.
- [ ] Before/After hooks for logging, value manipulation.
- [ ] Start server directly.

Server examples
- [ ] Success
- [ ] throwing simple Error (500)
- [ ] using this.throw(status, message)
- [ ] Promise
  - [ ] success / error
- [ ] Differently crafted URL
- [ ] URL params (/:id => (id))





## Quick Start

    npm install --save server-methods

### Server
Initialize the `server-methods` middleware with a [connect](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect) based web-server, for instance [Express](http://expressjs.com/):


    import express from 'express';
    import Server from 'server-methods';

    const app = express();
    Server.init(app);


Declare your server methods:

    Server.methods({
      'sum': (first, second) => {
        return first + second;
      },

      'myAsync': () => {
        // Return a promise for async operations.
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
          resolve({ text:'Some result' });
        });
      }
    });


### Client
On the client get a reference to the server proxy, and be sure to include this
file in your [WebPack](http://webpack.github.io/) build:

      import Server from 'server-methods/client'

Invoke the methods asynchronously with promises:

    Server.call('sum', 2, 1)
      .then(result => { // result: 3 })
      .catch(err => { ... });


## Example Server
To start the example server:

    npm run example

Then open your browser at `localhost:3030`.


## Test
    npm test
    npm run tdd  # Watch



## Development
To build the client javascript:

    npm run build



## Credit
Conceptually based on Meteor's server methods pattern.
