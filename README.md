# Rest Methods
Isomorphic, promise-based REST services.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/philcockfield/rest-methods.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/philcockfield/rest-methods)

Rapidly publish a set of javascript functions as a REST endpoint with a simple promise-based RPC style invocation on the client.  Automatically produces rich API documentation.

## Install

    npm install --save rest-methods


## Getting Started
#### Create The Server (Quick Start)
Create and start a new REST web-service with the internal connect server on a default port:
```js
var Service require("rest-methods/server");;
var service = Service({ name:'My Service' }).start();

```


#### Create Server (With Express and Options)
You may be wanting to expose you REST API as part of wider application.  Simply pass in your connect-based server as an option at setup.

```js
var express = require("express");
var Service = require("rest-methods/server");;

var app = express();
var service = Service({
  name:'My Service',
  version: '1.0.1',
  basePath: '/v1',
  connect: app
}).start({ port:3030 });
```

The example above shows additional configuration options, including your service's `version` and a base URL path that all REST urls are prefixed with.


## Craft Your API
Your service API is exposed by declaring methods. The following is the simplest kind of method declaration:

```js
service.methods({
  "user": function() {
      console.log(this);
      return { date:new Date() };
  }
});
```

Navigate to the services documentation in your browser ([`http://localhost:3030/v1`](http://localhost:3030/v1)) to see your method documented like so:

![Foo Method](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/185555/9016885/92f68662-3828-11e5-99f8-5308d6283524.png)

By declaring a single function, each of the HTTP verbs (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) is represented by the single handler.  

Click on the URL (`/v1/user`) to see the `GET` method executed, with the server console logging the `this` context that contains details about which verb was invoked and details about the URL.


## Modeling the REST API
We can craft the shape of the REST API in the following ways:

- Expose different handlers for each HTTP verb.
- Expose only a subset of HTTP verbs.
- Take parameters.
- Shape the URL with parameters.

For example, below we are crafting a `user` method that takes the ID of the user in the URL and passes it do the `GET/POST/PUT` methods.  We are choosing not to make a `DELETE` method available:

```js
service.methods({
  "user": {
    url: "/users/:id",
    get: function(id) { return { verb:'GET', date:new Date() }; },
    post: function(id, data) { return { verb:'POST', date:new Date(), id:id }; },
    put: function(id, data) { return { verb:'PUT', date:new Date(), id:id }; },
  }
});
```

The URL to this method would look something like this:

    /v1/users/123

...where the `id` is `123` which is passed to the correspondingly named parameters of each of the method handlers.

#### URL Parameters
Parameters that are baked into the URL are mapped to correspondingly named function parameters.  URL parameters must come before other parameters on your function definition.  

The service will help you out by throwing useful error messages if you declare something that it is not expecting.

URL parameters can also be placed within the query string, for example:

```js
{
  url: "/books/:year?skip=:skip&take=:take",
  get: function(year, skip, take) { ... }
}
```

#### Documentation
Providing JSDocs style comments enhances the published documentation for consumers of your service.  The `docs` field can contain markdown along with `@param {type}` details for each parameter:

```js
service.methods({
  "user": {
    docs: `
    Retrieves and manages the specified user, including:
    - Profile
    - Friends
    - Access history

    @param {string} id: The unique identifier of the user.
    @param {object} data: The user data to update.
    `,
    url: "/users/:id",
    get: function(id) { return { verb:'GET', date:new Date() }; },
    post: function(id, data) { return { verb:'POST', date:new Date(), id:id }; },
    put: function(id, data) { return { verb:'PUT', date:new Date(), id:id }; },
  }
});

```

## Invoking Methods (Isomorphic/Promises)
A consistent isomorphic experience if provided for consuming your REST service, making it fast and convenient to invoke REST methods without needing to maintain URL manipulation code.

The service can be consumed using a dynamically created promise-based client library from:

- The browser
- A remote server
- The REST service itself.

### Invoking From the Browser
The following sample HTML page references the `browser.js` script and then invokes a method on the server using promises:

```html
<html>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="/v1/browser.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">
    /*
      Wait for client the service to be ready.
         This is pulling the API manifest from the server and
         constructing the client-method stubs.
    */
    RestService.onReady(function() {

        // Invoke the PUT method on the "users/:id" resource.
        RestService.methods.user.put(123, { name:"Alicia" })
        .then(function(result) {
            console.log("result", result);
        })
        .catch(function(err) {
            console.log("error", err);
        })

    });
  </script>
</html>
```

The client calls the service to receive the [method manifest](http://localhost:3030/methods.manifest.json) which it uses to create a set of helper functions that call the method over XHR at the correctly formatted URL and returns a promise.

If you were using [WebPack](http://webpack.github.io/) you would not need to reference the `browser.js` script, rather just require `rest-methods/browser` within your WebPack build.

#### Method Namespaces
Methods are stored by name on the `.methods` object.  You can introduce the concept of namespacing by using a `/` within your method names, for example:

```js
// On the server:
service.methods({
  "auth/users": () => {}
  "auth/groups/roles": () => {}
});

// On the client:
RestService.methods.auth.users.get()
.then(function(result){ ... });

RestService.methods.auth.groups.roles.get()
.then(function(result){ ... });
```



### Invoking From Remote Server
To invoke from another server, pass the host to connect to.  Because this is isomorphic, from there the programming idiom is identical to the browser:

```js
var RestService = require("rest-methods/client");
var service = RestService({ host:"localhost:3030" });

service.onReady(function() {

    // Invoke the PUT method on the "users/:id" resource.
    service.methods.user.put(123, { name:"Alicia" })
    .then(function(result) {
      console.log("result", result);
    });

});
```



### Invoking From The Service Itself
And again, invoking from methods from service itself is identical as a remote client.  This allows you to write shared code between the client and server that uses the promise-based method stubs.

```js
// Declaring the service API.
service.methods({
  "foo/bar": (data) => { ... }
});

// Invoking a method locally within your server module.
service.methods.foo.bar.put({ stuff:123 })
.then((result) => { ... })
.catch((err) => { ... });

```

## Throwing Errors
Throwing elegant and helpful errors is easy.  Within your service method use the `this.throw()` helper:

```js
// On the server.
service.methods({
  "foo": (id) => {
    this.throw(404, `A foo with the id '${ id }' does not exist.`);
  }
});

// On the client.
service.methods.foo.get(123)
.catch((err) => {
  // Error contains status-code, method-name and message.
})


```

This will ensure that a rich `ServerMethodError` will be passed back up to the client's `catch` callback containing your HTTP status-code, your error message as well as details about the method that threw the error that will be helpful in debugging.
